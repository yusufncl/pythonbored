# Project 01 | BlackJack | Casino Series

As part of my mini Casino Series to gather a better understanding of game theory I have dived into what I consider to be the simplest card game of them all - the game of Blackjack.

In this game the objective is to get a pair of cards with a value greater than the dealer's pair without going over 21 - this is called going bust.
